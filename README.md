# TestTask
It is a basic implementation, but for "real life" it needs more strategic API structure and different improvementsshould be done:

Class autoload
Logging and proper error handling
Based on API consumers gat response formats and status codes for not positive scenarios.
Unit Tests
SQL Queries profiling on big data sets. Add indexation if needed
For event types (click, play, view) use enum type in database (in case of MySQL)
Depends on situation and database, for boosting performance pivot table can be created or cache can be implemented, etc.
